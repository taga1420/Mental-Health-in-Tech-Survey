# Mental-Health-in-Tech-Survey
Repository to work Kaggle challenge.

Given the database available at https://www.kaggle.com/osmi/mental-health-in-tech-survey a simple study was performed to understand the  best predictive factors of a mental illness.
This dataset is from a 2014 survey that measures attitudes toward mental health and the frequency of mental health disorders in the workplace.

The work was divided in the following steps:
- Data cleaning;
- Data Visualization;
- Feature selection;
- Clustering;
- Classification.

Steps 2 to 4 were develped using WEKA. Weka is a collection of machine learning algorithms for data mining tasks. It contains tools for data preparation, classification, regression, clustering, association rules mining, and visualization.

Step 5 was developed in python. It can be found in teste.py.
